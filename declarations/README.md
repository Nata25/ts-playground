Declarations are used for external modules in JavaScript for the code 
to be compatible with TypeScript. 

In this example, we have a `showMessage` function and a declaration for it 
generated by TypeScript command `tsc --declaration ts/showMessage.ts`. Now
the script.ts can use the function in `showMessage.js` (JavaScript) without any compilation errors. (Though we need to import this first). 

Note that `"outDir": "js"` compiler option in `tsconfig.json` is ignored 
in this case and output `showMessage.js` file is generated in the same location (root). With the flag `--outDir js` specified in command line, both `d.ts` and `.js` output files will be saved in the specified directory (here it's `js/`).
