## Modules in TypeScript

Here're the examples of exporting an interface, classes (with and without `new` keyword) as well as default and named exports.

All these can be run in Node.js environment using command `node js/script.js` 
or displayed in a browser using a simple Node.js http server with command `node js/server.js` or `npm start`.
