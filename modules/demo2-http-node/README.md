## Modules in TypeScript

Here're the examples of exporting an interface, classes (with and without `new` keyword) as well as default and named exports.

All these can be run in Node.js environment using command `node dist/script.js` 
or displayed in a browser using a simple Node.js http server with the command `node server.js` or `npm run node`.

_Note:_ JavaScript output files are not included. Generate them via `tsc` command prior to running node.
