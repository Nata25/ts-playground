## ArrayUtilities modules

This is a browser demo for TypeScript modules using `Express.js`, `System.js` (`Require.js` opiton was implemented on the one of past commits), `lodash`.

For compiliation, use `tsc` (JavaScript output files are not included it the repo) and `npm start` to run the server.
